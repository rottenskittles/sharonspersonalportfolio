            <h3 class="rightheader">where i've been</h3>
            <p class="rightalign">I was raised in central New York, but have moved around a lot and currently live in
                central California. Despite the fact that I moved around a lot before I was even 13, I was still able to
                connect with people in every place I’ve been in, and I’m glad I’ve been able to.</p>
            </div>
            <h3 class="rightheader">education</h3>
            <p class="rightalign">I go to Clovis East High School, with an expected graduation date of June of 2025. In
                school, I am in classes like English 11 Honors, Web Application Development (both at the Center for
                Advanced Research and Technology, or CART for short), and color guard. Next year, I plan on taking
                Ceramics and Honors English while continuing with color guard.</p>
            <p class="rightalign">I like being involved in various activities at school. As mentioned, I have been, am,
                and will continue to be in color guard, but I have also taken classes like art and dance. Along with
                that, I am the advisor the the Black Student Union (or BSU, for short) at my school.</p>
            <p>After school, I plan on going into dermatology. Even though I am taking a web class, I suddenly remembered how passionate I was about skincare in early May of 2024. I thought back to when I was younger and skin had just become something important to me due to the unavoidable milestone called puberty, which came with acne. Along with that, I dealt with hyperpigmentation, which made me insecure. Going into dermatology can help girls that were just like me have a chance to feel however they want to feel again about their skin. Dermatology is also very white-dominated, and as someone whi is the complete opposite, I strive to change that — even if all I make is a small dent. Although website making and designing is fun, I just feel like dermatology is what’s calling my name now. I know the journey won’t be the easiest, but I’ll definitely work hard to get there.</p>

            <h3>hobbies & experience</h3>
            <p class="rightalign">As you may have already been able to tell, I am a very artistically active person. I
                love any and all art forms, to the point where I’ve even taken some of them on myself. Some of these
                forms include, drawing, fashion, photography, and music, which I’m all equally passionate about. If
                possible, I’d even like to take fashion or art as a minor in college.</p>

            <p class="imagefooter">a drawing of Michael Jacskon (aka the BEST artist) i made, circa 2021</p>
            <p class="rightalign">Along with that, I also love to cook and write stories — in fact, I’m writing a novel
                right now. I hope to finish it soon so I can publish, but with every piece of work, there’s a block. I’m
                sure I should have some ideas flowing through again soon enough, though.</p>
            <p>Some experiences I have in a work-like environment include tutoring, being a BSU advisor, doing finances
                for my church, and even having my own jewelry business. at one point. I feel like these experiences have
                helped with things like deadlines, finding ways to deal with tough situations, and getting things done
                as soon as possible while also making sure to be precise.</p>
