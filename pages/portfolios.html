            <h3 class="jic">just in case you were curious, here are some examples of the things that i like to do</h3>
            <h3>web/programming</h3>
            <p><a href="https://tinydinoss.netlify.app/"></a></p>
            <img src="/images/dino.png">
            <p>This is my first website I created, a dinosaur dossier. I made it in my Web Applications class at CART
                using HTML and CSS in Visual Studio Code. While I was making it, I definitely faced a lot of problems
                and challenges, but because I was able to reach out whenever I needed help on something, I was able to
                finish it successfully. Although it isn’t the best, I am still proud of it.</p>
            <p><a href="https://thetavernventures.netlify.app/"></a></p>
            <img src="/images/tventures.png">
            <p>This is my latest website that me and a partner made before this one, also made using HTML and CSS along
                with JavaScript in Visual Studio Code. We were assigned to make a text adventure-like game with various
                endings. This project was definitely difficult, because we don’t usually make things like this, but with
                the help of my teacher and some of my friends at CART, we were able to make a functioning game and I’m
                happy it turned out well.</p>
            <h3>writing</h3>
            <p><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Jgf07vk4lCQH8ZwvzqHRXtYwjQq637XI/view?usp=sharing"></a></p>
            <p>This is a short story I wrote in early May of 2024 using Google Docs. Coming up with certain parts of the
                story
                was difficult; I would run into writer blocks a lot of the time. I was able to get over it by taking
                some time off my work and allowing ideas to flow on their own before coming back to it. This taught me
                that even though working hard is important, taking time for myself is important as well.</p>
            <h3>drawing</h3>
            <p>I draw both traditionally and digitally. Drawing traditionally sort of came naturally to me (with some
                help from friends and art teachers), but drawing digitally was a little hard for me at first. Figuring
                out all the tools and what they do was difficult for me at first, but after learning what each thing
                does and techniques for things like facial features and anatomy, it was much easier. Here are examples
                of each.</p>

            <h3>fashion</h3>
            <p>I also love styling myself, and would like to go into it as a secondary career if possible. As all things
                are, styling can be difficult sometimes. Sometimes you can’t think of what matches with what, or your
                idea doesn’t look as you envisioned it. A way I got over this is by looking online for inspiration, and
                just going with the way I feel that day. Music also helps; somehow it correlates with the clothes I put
                on for the day or what I design. It definitely helps me get past creativity blocks. Here are a few
                examples of stylings I’ve done in the past.</p>
